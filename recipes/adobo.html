        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And I have got to say, it is definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo.</p>
